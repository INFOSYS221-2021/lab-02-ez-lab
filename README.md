# Exercise 01
Steps:

### Understand

* Do we have to use only roads?
* Is it the Univeristy of Auckland?
* Is convenient fastest or easiest?

### Find Strategy

* Can you work backwards to solve the problem?
* Can we draw a diagram or a map to solve the problem?
* Can we act it out and walk and time it ourselves?

### Solve the Problem

* Time the routes
* Measure the different distances

### Look Back

* Making sure the strategy works every time and is consistent
* Making sure we have found the most convenient/efficient route

# Exercise 02

### Understand

* What is an integer?
* Are these numbers negative?
* What is ascending?

### Find Strategy

* Use the divide and conquer algorithm strategy to recursively break down the problem into smaller problems and sort the numbers

### Solve the Problem

* Select an appropriate algorithm
* Write a program that executes the selected strategy

### Look Back

* Are the integers actually in ascending order?
* Was this the most efficient strategy we could have used or was there one better suited to the problem?
